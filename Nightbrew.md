# 终端随笔 Terminal Journal

## 2025-08-19 Tue

当别人打开游戏机，我却喜欢打开 Mac 的终端。  
While others open their game consoles, I prefer opening the Mac terminal.  

在安静的夜晚，我和 AI 聊聊 Homebrew，  
In the quiet of the night, I chat with AI about Homebrew,  

有时发现一个有趣的小功能，  
Sometimes I discover an interesting little feature,  

便像孩子得到新玩具般兴奋，立刻实验起来。  
And I get excited like a child with a new toy, immediately trying it out.  

这不是任务，而是探索。  
This is not a task, but an exploration.  

它让我感觉自己在创造，在成长，  
It makes me feel like I’m creating, like I’m growing,  

哪怕从最消极的角度说，  
Even if I put it in the most passive way,  

它也至少是一种有价值的消磨时光。  
At the very least, it is a valuable way to spend my time.
