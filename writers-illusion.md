# Writer’s Illusion  
# 作家的错觉  

今天我在 GitHub 上写了三篇笔记小作文。  
Today I wrote three short essays in my GitHub repository.  

在 AI 的帮助下，效率直接起飞。  
With the help of AI, my efficiency skyrocketed.  

这种感觉让我产生了一种错觉：我也可以是一个作家。  
This feeling gave me an illusion: I, too, could be a writer.  

当然，我写的不是小说，也不是散文，而是中英文对照的随笔。  
Of course, I am not writing novels or prose, but rather bilingual reflections.  

它们短小，却真切；它们技术味十足，却又带有个人色彩。  
They are short yet sincere; technical in flavor, yet personal in tone.  

或许，写作从来就不是某种遥不可及的身份，而是记录、表达和分享的过程。  
Perhaps writing has never been an unattainable identity, but simply the act of recording, expressing, and sharing.  

在这样的过程中，我体会到了一点属于作家的快乐。  
Through this process, I tasted a bit of the joy that belongs to writers.
